### Summary

There are a couple of major findings of the analysis:
* The major users are male subscriber.
* Most of the time of use is in the early evening (4 to 8 pm)

Suggestion for future analysis:
* Add the costs (the actual repair cost) and revenues (how much we charge per mile or per minute) to the analysis. 
* Age (birth year) and male distribution. Since our major clientd are males. We can dig into the information a little bit deeper.
